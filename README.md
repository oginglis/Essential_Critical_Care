Essential Critical Care is a non-profit organisation that supports training for nurses and doctors caring for critically ill patients in low-resource settings. We use locally-led, interactive teaching methods and promote safe, respectful care for all patients. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we have adapted some of our training materials and methods to produce open access resources for COVID-19. These resources are not formally-peer reviewed and do not constitute official guidance unless otherwise indicated. We hope you will find them helpful.
